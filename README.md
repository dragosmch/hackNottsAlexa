# hackNottsAlexa

We built hackNottsAlexa for [HackNotts 2016](http://2016.hacknotts.com/). We found that our slackbot just wasn't cutting it and that it could often be hit and miss if you didn't use the right words. So we decided to leverage the natural language processing of Alexa and create something that allowed people to hold at least a semblance of a conversation with Alexa.

Also shoutout to @KayLerch for his help and for putting up with the constant questions.
